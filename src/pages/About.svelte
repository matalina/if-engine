<Markdown markdown="# About IF Engine

If Engine is an application designed to tell a story with random elements caused by dice rolls, oracles and LLMs.

It's a choose your own adventure style game where you create your own characters, your own world, and your own plot devices, but the mechanics of the game help you randomize the story you are telling, always keeping you and your characters on your toes.
